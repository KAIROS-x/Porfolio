      <h1>About Me<h1>
        <p>From Newport Beach Ca, moved here last year from England where i was working in the Air Force as an IT hardware speacialist/network maintenance. I moved here to go to school for aviation which I was enrolled in at PCC but because of VA complications I switched to Architechture, which I enjoyed but not on a professional level. After that i was kind of lost in the wind so i decieded to get back to my roots <em>(IT and Networks)</em> but the more research I did in the tech world i found programming to be an attractive option. I choose this school specifically because you guys have internships included in the course, which is very important for me.
